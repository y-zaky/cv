# CV - Yahia Zaky

I have spent the last 16 weeks studying fullstack JavaScript development at the Founders & Coders bootcamp in London. This has been a life‚Äêchanging experience for me, reinforcing my love for web development and helping others learn. I am now a developer who enjoys writing Javascript and Node.js.

Ultimately, my goal is to become awesome at writing simple, robust, scalable and readable code - through practice, learning and applying different programming paradigms, and by studying the approaches of other developers within an agile environment.
